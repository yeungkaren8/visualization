# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.

      Good viz: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lisa.trescott/viz/HowCommonIsYourBirthday_17222664505560/Birthday

      An objective visualization of birthdate frequencies from a reputable data source (US National Center for Health Statistics & US Social Security Administration), in which the graph encodes multiple attributes (rank from most to least common birthdate, month and day of the year) that are easily interpretated (by colour and coordinate of cell on graph, respectively). Based on the colours of the cells, it is easy to perceive a ringed cluster of darker cells in the months of July to September of more frequent birth dates. Additionally, the different sizes of the circles beside the month labels give us an estimation of the proportion of birthdates per month, in addition to the rank information given by the colour of the circle. Hovering over each cell gives the specific numerical data that informs the visualization of that particular date, giving us accurate information to complement the qualitative visual. The visuals allow us to gain a high-level comprehension of birthdate spread across the days of the year.
      

      Bad viz: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/fergus.smith/viz/FastFashionsEnvironmentalWakeUpCall/Dashboard1

      Many graphs that are difficult to interpret as they do not contain labels for their axes. For example, in the top left-hand graph of global population vs textile production, it is unclear what the X and Y axes of the lines are referring to â€“ eg. why are years labelled on the dotted line? What is the value and units of the global population and textile production plotted? In the bottom right-hand graph, what is the reasoning behind connecting certain pie charts together? What do the quartiles refer to in the colour scheme? What are the symbols representative of? Explanations are hidden in blocks of text that only appear when you hover over certain parts of the viz, which does not make the data intuitive to understand upon first glance. Conclusions are not readily apparent from the data presented, and require written explanations. Additionally, it is unclear where the data is sourced from.


      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      Good viz: It is difficult to interpret rankings cose together with this particular colour scale. Using a colour scheme with changing hues rather than just changing saturation might improve the separation of rankings better. It is difficult to accurately compare the frequency of birthdates by month using area of the circle beside each month label, so a different visualization (eg. length of a bar) would allow for better estimation and comparison.

      Bad viz: While the viz is creative, explicitly drawing and labelling of axes would greatly improve the interpretability of the data. For example, in the right-middle graph ("Specific industry's environmental (pulse) score"), indicating what the number, width of bar, and colour of bar corresponds to would help the viewer interpret the data, rather than relying on the written interpretation by the person who made the viz.


      
      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)

### Why am I doing this assignment?:

- This assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses the learning outcomes
